## 🌐 Network Penetration Testing

### 🧭 **What is Network Penetration Testing?**

Network Penetration Testing is a simulated cyberattack against your organization's network infrastructure. The objective is to **uncover hidden vulnerabilities** in your systems, devices, and configurations before real attackers do. By mimicking the tools and tactics of real-world hackers, we help you strengthen your defenses against both internal and external threats.

Whether you're managing cloud-based platforms, internal corporate networks, or hybrid infrastructures, this testing ensures your network is:

* Secure from unauthorized access
* Resilient to modern cyberattacks
* Aligned with industry standards and regulations

### ⚙️ **Our Methodology for Network Penetration Testing**

We follow industry-recognized frameworks such as **NIST SP 800-115**, **MITRE ATT\&CK**, and **OSSTMM**, combining both **automated tools** and **manual expertise** to evaluate your network from every angle.

#### 🔍 1. **Vulnerability Assessment**

We begin by scanning your network for known weaknesses and outdated systems that could be exploited.

* Detect missing security patches and updates
* Identify software and firmware vulnerabilities
* Find configuration weaknesses in firewalls, routers, switches, and servers

#### 🧭 2. **Network Mapping & Enumeration**

Understanding your network is key. We map the infrastructure to visualize attack paths and exposed services.

* Identify active hosts and open ports
* Uncover internal/external IPs, DNS, VPNs, and exposed services
* Analyze service banners and fingerprint OS/devices

#### 💥 3. **Controlled Exploitation**

We safely exploit identified vulnerabilities to test their real-world impact — without disrupting your operations.

* Test known exploits and zero-days in a sandboxed manner
* Simulate lateral movement techniques
* Validate exploitability, not just detection

#### 🔐 4. **Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement**

Once inside, we test how far an attacker could go — from low-level access to domain admin.

* Explore shared drives, credentials, Active Directory
* Test pivoting between VLANs/subnets
* Identify excessive user permissions

#### 📄 5. **Comprehensive Reporting & Mitigation Strategy**

You’ll receive a detailed yet digestible report including:

* Risk-rated findings and technical details
* Visual maps of attack paths
* Proof-of-concept evidence (PoCs)
* Actionable, prioritized remediation plan
