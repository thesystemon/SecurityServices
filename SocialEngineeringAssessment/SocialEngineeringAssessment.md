## 🕵️‍♂️ Social Engineering Assessment

### 🧭 **What is Social Engineering Assessment?**

While firewalls and software patches guard your systems, attackers often go after the weakest link — **your people**. Social Engineering Assessment simulates real-world deception techniques like phishing, pretexting, and baiting to test how your employees respond to manipulation attempts.

These simulations expose **how susceptible your organization is to human-based attacks**, helping you fortify policies, train staff, and build a truly resilient security posture.

Whether you’re in finance, healthcare, IT, or education, human-targeted attacks can bypass even the best technical defenses — **this service helps stop them at the source.**

### ⚙️ **Our Social Engineering Testing Approach**

Our strategy blends ethical psychology-based testing with industry frameworks like **NIST SP 800-53**, **SANS SEC566**, and **ISO/IEC 27001 social control objectives**. We customize each assessment to your organization’s risk profile and employee roles.

#### 📧 1. **Phishing Simulation**

Fake emails, messages, or login pages designed to trick users into giving away credentials or clicking harmful links.

* Evaluate staff response to phishing emails
* Identify high-risk user groups
* Measure the effectiveness of current awareness training

#### 🎭 2. **Pretexting Scenarios**

We simulate social manipulation tactics — such as impersonating internal staff or vendors — to test human trust barriers.

* Assess employee verification of requests
* Measure susceptibility to authority-based manipulation
* Validate escalation and reporting protocols

#### 🚪 3. **Tailgating & Physical Intrusion**

We attempt to physically access restricted areas without authorization, highlighting lapses in vigilance and procedure.

* Identify flaws in physical access control
* Test employee assertiveness with unknown individuals
* Analyze front desk, visitor, and badge protocols

#### 🎁 4. **Baiting Techniques**

We place enticing but malicious media (like USB drives or fake promotional material) to test how employees react.

* Monitor reactions to found devices or downloads
* Educate on risks from unauthorized physical media
* Promote "Stop and Report" behavior

#### 📊 5. **Reporting & Awareness Reinforcement**

Post-assessment, we deliver actionable insights and help roll out targeted training to close awareness gaps.

* Human risk score by department or role
* Behavioral trends and training gaps
* Custom awareness plans with visual reports
