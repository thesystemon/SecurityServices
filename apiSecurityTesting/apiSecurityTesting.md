## 🔐 API Penetration Testing Service

### 🧭 **What is API Penetration Testing?**

API Penetration Testing is a comprehensive security evaluation that simulates real-world attacks on your application programming interfaces (APIs). These APIs are the backbone of modern applications — enabling communication between mobile apps, web services, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.

This testing identifies vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to:

* Bypass authentication
* Access or modify sensitive data
* Disrupt system functionality
* Compromise user privacy

Whether you run a fintech platform, e-commerce backend, SaaS service, or healthcare system, securing your APIs is **mission-critical**.

### ⚙️ **How We Approach API Penetration Testing**

Our methodology follows the latest security standards, including the **OWASP API Security Top 10**, **NIST SP 800-115**, and **MITRE ATT\&CK** framework. We combine automated tools with deep manual testing to uncover hidden threats and misconfigurations.

#### 🔑 1. **Authentication & Authorization Testing**

We assess how your APIs manage user identity and access.

* Test OAuth2, JWT, API keys
* Validate role-based access control (RBAC)
* Simulate privilege escalation attacks

#### 🧬 2. **Input Validation & Injection Testing**

APIs often handle direct input from users and other systems — improper handling can be fatal.

* Test for SQL, NoSQL, command injections
* Analyze input sanitization
* Evaluate GraphQL and REST input handling

#### ⚠️ 3. **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**

We simulate abuse scenarios to test your API’s resilience under pressure.

* Brute-force login attempts
* DDoS simulation
* Bypass of rate-limiting and throttling controls

#### 🔍 4. **Sensitive Data Exposure**

We check whether your APIs accidentally expose:

* PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
* API keys or tokens
* Internal error messages and debug info

#### ⚙️ 5. **Security Misconfigurations**

APIs often suffer from insecure defaults or improper configurations.

* CORS policy misconfigurations
* Deprecated or unused endpoints
* Missing or weak HTTP security headers

#### 🛡️ 6. **Business Logic & Workflow Flaws**

We go beyond technical flaws and test how your API handles real-world workflows.

* Abuse of endpoint chaining
* Manipulation of request sequences
* Testing payment logic, discount codes, or subscription cycles

#### 📝 7. **Reporting & Remediation Guidance**

You’ll receive a clear, tailored report with:

* Severity-based vulnerability breakdown
* OWASP alignment and CVSS scores
* Screenshots, PoCs (proofs of concept)
* Developer-focused remediation guidance

#### 🔁 8. **Free Retesting**

After you’ve fixed vulnerabilities, we offer **free retesting** within 30 days to verify successful remediation.
