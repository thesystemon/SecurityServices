## 🧩 Source Code Review

### 🧭 **What is Source Code Review?**

Source Code Review is a **deep-dive security analysis** of your application's source code to identify vulnerabilities, insecure coding practices, and logic flaws — before attackers do. It goes beyond scanning for bugs by exposing **hidden flaws** in the way your software is written, structured, and maintained.

This is a critical layer of defense for applications handling sensitive data, financial transactions, or regulated content — especially when paired with other assessments like penetration testing.

Whether your stack involves Java, .NET, Python, JavaScript, or Go — **our review process ensures your code is clean, secure, and standards-compliant.**

### ⚙️ **Our Approach to Secure Code Review**

We follow a hybrid methodology combining **Static Analysis (SAST)**, **Dynamic Testing (DAST)**, and **manual inspection**. Our techniques are aligned with OWASP Code Review Guide, CWE/SANS Top 25, and ISO/IEC 27034.

#### 🔍 1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**

We perform automated and manual white-box analysis to uncover security risks in your source code — without executing the application.

* Detect insecure coding patterns
* Identify hardcoded secrets, logic errors, and insecure APIs
* Flag violations of secure development standards

#### 💻 2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**

We test the application in a runtime environment to uncover vulnerabilities in the behavior of the code when it's live.

* Identify real-time threats like SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection
* Analyze input validation, authentication, and session management issues
* Validate SAST results with behavioral impact

#### 🔁 3. **Manual Code Inspection**

Automated tools can't catch everything. Our experts manually review critical modules and high-risk logic to spot:

* Authentication bypasses
* Authorization flaws
* Business logic abuse scenarios
* Race conditions and edge-case issues

#### 🔐 4. **DevSecOps Alignment**

We embed secure coding practices into your CI/CD pipeline:

* Automated security scans at every commit
* Developer-friendly reporting
* Early issue identification before staging or production
